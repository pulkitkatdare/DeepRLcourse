#  [Berkeley DeepRL course](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) Homework
This is the code implementation of the berkeley deepRL course. Most of the code implementation is in pytorch

## Homework 1: Imitation Learning 
Basically includes an implementation of two primitive imitation learning algorithm
